						<h2>Kroki</h2>
						<h4>Eyes</h4>
						<p>I see your blue eyes 
							and your broken heart 
							when I'm thinking about you 
							I bend over backwards 
							To show you why I'm here 
							to show you how I care<br>
							
							I can't cross it 
							i can't hold my tongue 
							but I love the way you look at me 
							I love the way you smile 
							look and smileâ€¦<br>
							
							It's hard to choose my way 
							but I choose to follow my heart,
							your voice is bringing me down 
							One wish to give you proof 
							I got one wish to cover my heart,
							your voice is bringing me down.
						</p>

						<h4>Hypnotized</h4>
						<p>I catch your eyes ,try not to smile
			    		   I track your style I feel your vibes
						   We have a drink then go outside
						   Talk for a while and then we kiss
						   And then we kiss x2
						   We play the game we start to move 
						   I feel my heart you feel the bit
						   I take your hand you turn down slow 
						   We start to feel Its time to go.<br>
									
						   Tonight moon it will hit the sky 
						   And its no surprise well wake up with you 
						   Right I shouldnt compromise,
						   I dont have to think twice What to do 
						   You got me hypnotized x3
						</p>

						<h4>Nothing Else Matters</h4>
						<p>So close no matter how far
						   Couldn't be much more from the heart
						   Forever trusting who we are
						   And nothing else matters<br>
	
						   Never opened myself this way
						   Life is ours, we live it our way
						   All these words I don't just say
						   And nothing else matters<br>
	
						   Trust I seek and I find in you
						   Every day for us something new
						   Open mind for a different view
						   And nothing else matters<br>

						   Never cared for what they do
						   Never cared for what they know
						   But I know</p>
