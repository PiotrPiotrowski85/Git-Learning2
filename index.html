						<h3>Eyes</h3>
						<p>I see your blue eyes 
							and your broken heart 
							when I'm thinking about you 
							I bend over backwards 
							To show you why I'm here 
							to show you how I care
							
							I can't cross it 
							i can't hold my tongue 
							but I love the way you look at me 
							I love the way you smile 
							look and smileâ€¦ 
							
							It's hard to choose my way 
							but I choose to follow my heart,
							your voice is bringing me down 
							One wish to give you proof 
							I got one wish to cover my heart,
							your voice is bringing me down
						</p>

						<h3>Nothing Else Matters</h3>
						<p>So close no matter how far
						   Couldn't be much more from the heart
						   Forever trusting who we are
                           And nothing else matters

                           Never opened myself this way
                           Life is ours, we live it our way
                           All these words I don't just say
                           And nothing else matters

                           Trust I seek and I find in you
                           Every day for us something new
						   Open mind for a different view
						   And nothing else matters</p>

						<h3>Hypnotized</h3>
						<p>I catch your eyes ,try not to smile
						   I track your style I feel your vibes
						   We have a drink then go outside
						   Talk for a while and then we kiss
						   And then we kiss x2
						   We play the game we start to move 
						   I feel my heart you feel the bit
						   I take your hand you turn down slow 
						   We start to feel Its time to go.
								
						   Tonight moon it will hit the sky 
						   And its no surprise well wake up with you 
						   Right I shouldnt compromise,
						   I dont have to think twice What to do 
						   You got me hypnotized x3 
								
						   So we slide into the night and to the wild open flow
						   Oh stary eyes you see me glow so will I hide or will I show 
						   You watch me dance I feel you move You pull me near nothing to fear 
						   We drifted outside,dream aside until we slide into the light</p>
